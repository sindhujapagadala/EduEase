## Inspiration
   In recent times, educators in schools, coaching centers, and colleges often struggle with overwhelming workloads, especially when tasked with providing individualized feedback to students in large classrooms. The high teacher-to-student ratios exacerbate this issue, leaving educators with limited time to focus on their core responsibilities of teaching and mentoring. As a result, teachers are increasingly prone to stress and burnout, often lacking adequate support, which hinders their ability to efficiently manage their responsibilities.
